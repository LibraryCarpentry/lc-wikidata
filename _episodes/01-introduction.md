![Wikidata_Main_Page](../fig/Wikidata_Main_Page.png)  
*Screenshot of [Wikidata Main Page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)*

- Earth (Q2) - Screenshot and link to page (Participants should visit the page https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2)
- Description of Earth (Q2) as an example for an entry
    - Title - Earth (Q2)
    - What does "Q2"?
    - What is an item https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Items
        - Has 
            - unique identifier (Q + a number)
            - label 
            - description
            - aliases
    - "Statement" section
        - What is a statement?
            - Has
                - property (P + a number)
                - value
                - qualifier (optional)
                - references (optional)
            - is a so called triple which will be explained later
    - As you can see a property can have multiple statements for one property; for example "Population"; they are specified by "qualifiers" like point in time; an can references e.g. population at the 5 January 2016 has the reference http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/ as source.
    - Usually pages can be edited by anyonce; click the pen on the upper-right; Q2 - Earth is semi-protected (as it is very important); don't worry you made a mistake, you can alway go back in history
    - "View history" - more later
    - "Log in" and other things for registered users
