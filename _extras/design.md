## Design decision :bulb:

Sometime there is more than one way to do something. Here are some
reason why we did certain things in a certain manner.

## Write what you decide :pencil2:

In lesson development, many decisions are made within group discussions, sprints or conferences. In order to be able to track these, it is useful to store a meeting_notes.md in the repo.
This md file documents all discussions that have been held and all decisions that have been made, to make the development easier to understand for newcomers. To make such a meeting_notes.md file was also one decision at a certain time and now is also tracked! :+1:

## Edit first vs. create first

In order to lower the hurdle for first edit the idea was suggested on
the WikiCite 2019 brain storming that at first a exiting article
should be edited and then later a new one should be created. This
comes with the disadvantage, that either the participants work on
rather different items (e.g. find something via the random item link)
or the instructor has to pick/create for each participant a suiting
item. Due to this we decided to rather start with the creation of new
items in the Wikidata test instance (which needs only 4 fields to be
filled out).

## Keep lessons as simple as possible

## Pacing and overall schedule

* Pacing: The modularity of the lesson allows instructors to select the amount of content
appropriate to the needs of the learners. 
* Each module has 15 minutes of stretch content which may be optionally included.
* There is an additional 30 minutes built into the startup time to accomodate delays. 

### Possible paths through the lesson

#### Only teaching the basics
* Startup
* Episode 1: What is Wikidata?
* Epidose 2: Underlying concepts of Wikidata
* Episode 3: Introduction into editing
* Episode 5: Introduction to querying

#### Full day option
* Startup + What is Wikidata + Underlying concepts + Intro into editing + advanced editing + lunch + intro to querying + advanced bulk updating, bots
