## Pacing and overall schedule

* Pacing: The modularity of the lesson allows instructors to select the amount of content
appropriate to the needs of the learners. 
* Each module has 15 minutes of stretch content which may be optionally included.
* There is an additional 30 minutes built into the startup time to accomodate delays. 

### Possible paths through the lesson

#### Slow morning OR afternoon
* Startup + standard library
* Startup + pandas 

#### Average speed morning OR afternoon            
* Startup + standard library + pandas
* Startup + standard library + standard library stretch
* Startup + pandas + pandas stretch
        
#### Full day option
* Startup + standard library + standard library stretch + lunch + pandas + pandas stretch
